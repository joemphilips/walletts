## contributing

To run integration test, you must first run `docker-compose up` and 
`yarn integration`

bws test suite creates new wallet (and puts its pubkey onto the server) each time it runs.
But since a bws has a cap for its wallet number able to create from same ip,
you may have to re-run docker by `docker-compose down && docker-compose up`
